# How to determine the best period for a PyTechnicalIndicators function

This guide shows how to programmatically determine the best period for your indicator using the Python package PyTechnicalIndicators.

The rating model is overly simplified and should be refined to suit your needs before usage.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- Determine the best period for the RSI from a year of data

> This guide assumes you can load price data from a CSV file (see the "Get data from CSV" section below).

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install PyTechnicalIndicators:

```bash
pip install pytechnicalindicators
```

---

## ðŸ’» Step-by-Step

### 1. Get data from CSV

This example expects a CSV file with either:

- a header containing a "close" column (case-insensitive), or
- a single column of prices (no header)

Example loader:

```python
import csv

def load_prices_from_csv(path: str) -> list[float]:
    prices: list[float] = []
    with open(path, "r", newline="") as f:
        # Try to read as DictReader first (with a header)
        sample = f.read(4096)
        f.seek(0)
        has_header = "," in sample and any(ch.isalpha() for ch in sample.splitlines()[0])
        if has_header:
            reader = csv.DictReader(f)
            # Find a 'close' column in a case-insensitive way
            close_key = None
            if reader.fieldnames:
                for k in reader.fieldnames:
                    if k and k.lower() == "close":
                        close_key = k
                        break
            if close_key is None and reader.fieldnames:
                # Fallback to the first column if 'close' not found
                close_key = reader.fieldnames[0]
            for row in reader:
                try:
                    prices.append(float(row[close_key]))
                except (ValueError, TypeError, KeyError):
                    continue
        else:
            # No header: read first column only
            f.seek(0)
            reader = csv.reader(f)
            for row in reader:
                if not row:
                    continue
                try:
                    prices.append(float(row[0]))
                except ValueError:
                    continue
    return prices
```

### 2. Calculate the RSI for multiple periods

The default RSI period is 14. Weâ€™ll iterate from 2 to 15 to see if a different period performs better (excluding 1 to avoid degenerate windows).

```python
from pytechnicalindicators import momentum_indicators as mi

model = "smoothed_moving_average"  # default for RSI
# Example:
# rsi_series = mi.bulk.relative_strength_index(prices, model, period)
```

### 3. Rate each different RSI to find the best

> The logic is overly simple for the purpose of the guide.

- If RSI > 70 (overbought) and the next price < current price, the period gets +1
- If RSI < 30 (oversold) and the next price > current price, the period gets +1

We normalize the score by the number of "attempts" (how many times we evaluated a signal).

Note: For period p, rsi[0] corresponds to prices index i = p (0-based). Weâ€™ll align indices accordingly.

```python
def choose_best_rsi_period(prices: list[float], min_p: int = 2, max_p: int = 15) -> tuple[int, float]:
    from pytechnicalindicators import momentum_indicators as mi

    best_rating = -1.0
    best_period = min_p
    model = "smoothed_moving_average"

    for p in range(min_p, max_p + 1):
        rsi = mi.bulk.relative_strength_index(prices, model, p)

        current_rating = 0.0
        attempts = 0.0

        # rsi[0] aligns with prices index i = p
        for i in range(p, len(prices) - 1):
            rsi_val = rsi[i - p]

            # Overbought: expect price to fall next step
            if rsi_val > 70.0:
                attempts += 1.0
                if prices[i + 1] < prices[i]:
                    current_rating += 1.0

            # Oversold: expect price to rise next step
            if rsi_val < 30.0:
                attempts += 1.0
                if prices[i + 1] > prices[i]:
                    current_rating += 1.0

        average_rating = (current_rating / attempts) if attempts > 0 else 0.0
        if average_rating > best_rating:
            best_rating = average_rating
            best_period = p

    return best_period, best_rating
```

### 4. Full example

```python
import sys

# Reuse load_prices_from_csv and choose_best_rsi_period from above

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python choose_period.py <path_to_csv>")
        sys.exit(1)

    csv_path = sys.argv[1]
    prices = load_prices_from_csv(csv_path)

    print(f"Loaded {len(prices)} prices")

    if len(prices) < 16:
        print("Not enough data to evaluate RSI periods up to 15.")
        sys.exit(1)

    best_period, best_rating = choose_best_rsi_period(prices, min_p=2, max_p=15)
    print(f"Best period for RSI is {best_period} with a rating of {best_rating}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## ðŸ§ª Output

A runnable sample of the code can be found in [`choose_period.py`](https://github.com/chironmind/PyTechnicalIndicators-How-To-guides/blob/main/examples/choose_period.py)

```text
Loaded 251 prices
Best period for RSI is 7 with a rating of 0.5555555555555556
```

## âœ… Next Steps

- Programmatically choose a [constant model type](choose-constant-model-type.md))
- Combine period selection and constant model type selection
- Introduce the notion of punishment to the rating system (e.g., penalize false signals/whipsaws)
